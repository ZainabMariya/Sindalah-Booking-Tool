# Sindalah-Booking-Tool
Sindalah is set to be the first destination open to the public in Neom, which is a megacity project planned by
his Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, already one of the world's most ambitious
sustainable urban developments.
The island resort will be spread over approximately 840,000 square meters, with one of the main aims of the
development being to conserve natural beauty â€” one of Neom's central themes. The resort will include luxury
hotels and a large marina, beach club, yacht club, and wellness centre as well as 51 luxury retail outlets.
Sindalah is set to feature 413 premium rooms across three luxury hotels, as well as 88 villas, 333 serviced
apartments, nine fine-dining restaurants, nine casual restaurants, some with rooftop lounges. Sindalah is set to
open early in 2024. The island is expected to receive 2,400 visitors a day by 2028.
